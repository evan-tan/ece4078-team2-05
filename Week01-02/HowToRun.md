# How to run
- Make sure your environment is setup already, if not follow [this setup guide](https://github.com/tianleimin/ECE4078_Lab/blob/master/Week01-02/GazeboPenguinPiStetup.md)
- Open a new terminal window, and run `python3 keyboardControlStarter.py`
- Wait for a few seconds until initial message on screen disappears
- Press W,A,S,D to control the robot and arrow keys to increase/decrease acceleration and steering respectively.

## NOTE:
Controls for the robot need to be input to the **terminal window**, not OpenCV window!
